  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motel Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/1024206784"&gt;<a data-btn href="https://vimeo.com/1024206784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intro video</a>&lt;/a&gt;) - motel sunshine is an episodic 6DoF VR experience location locked to the fictional motel sunshine, but filmed and recorded in real time. Viewers are given the freedom to choose to see the stories unfurl from the eyes of their favorite characters, or to choose their own path and explore the wildly realistic world of motel sunshine on their own without bounds. The seasons cap off with one (or more) of the main characters, all of whom work at the motel, leaving for good. It&#39;s a reflective idea that the user should want to leave the XR environment Every visit holds an entirely new visit with an entirely new perspective to understand, but Motel sunshine is no hotel california. Those who have the privledge to see what&#39;s behind each door become better for it, and in the end should enjoy finding themselves where they truly aught to be. This Work In Progress is limited by the recording, editing, and distrobution technology currently available. Ideally Motel Sunshine is to be recorded on location, in realtime, with 360 cameras streamed to an ai enhanced software which converts to a lightweight 4d gaussian splat, edited with temporally and spatially agnostic 4d asset software (i don&#39;t even know what it would be called and have done the research), and available to download on to VR hardware or cloud software. Though most of the elements readily exist, i do not have access. Additionally, traditional script writing does not function properly for this style of viewer exploratory filmmaking. I have done some coding work on creating an application that can help with that process, but don&#39;t have the necessary space or compute to finalize it as of yet. With compute and access to core tech and interested parties I can make motel sunshine the first VR native episodic series, it would be very fun and cool.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Struck&lt;/strong&gt; - homestruck is the story of a child who is searching for their place, their people, but must first experience the world. Written as a novel in the second person, the reader becomes a part of the story unlike anything else. You, directly get to follow Sam&#39;s path navigating the difficult decision sin life, and at the end you get to decide for yourself if those decisions were made for the better. The VR filmic release puts the viewer into the story, though through the written narrative as the anonymous &quot;you&quot; character, in the VR film 6DoF experience truly give you an experience through a person&#39;s life that can be seen time and again, but never the same way twice. This work in progress is continuously being written. The filmic release is limited by technology of recording (outdoor, on location with a moveable rig), editing, and distrobution. The writing of any VR filmic 6DoF experience is limited by applicablitity of current sricpt writting methods.&lt;/p&gt;
