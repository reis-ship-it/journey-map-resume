  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motel Sunshine&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/1024206784"&gt;<a data-btn href="https://vimeo.com/1024206784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intro video</a>&lt;/a&gt;) - motel sunshine is an episodic 6DoF VR experience, location-locked to the fictional motel sunshine but filmed and recorded in real time. viewers can choose to see stories unfold through the eyes of their favorite characters, or choose their own path and explore the wildly realistic world of motel sunshine without bounds. seasons cap off with one (or more) of the main characters, all of whom work at the motel, leaving for good. it is reflective by design: the user should want to leave the XR environment. every visit holds a new perspective to understand, but motel sunshine is no hotel california. those who have the privilege to see what is behind each door become better for it, and in the end should enjoy finding themselves where they truly ought to be. this &lt;mark&gt;Work in Progress&lt;/mark&gt; is limited by the recording, editing, and distribution technology currently available. ideally, motel sunshine is recorded on location in real time, with 360 cameras streamed to AI-enhanced software that converts footage into lightweight 4D gaussian splats, edited with temporally and spatially agnostic 4D asset software (i still do not know what to call it, but i have done the research), and made available for VR hardware or cloud software. though most elements already exist, i do not have access yet. additionally, traditional script writing does not function properly for this style of viewer-exploratory filmmaking. i have done coding work on an application that can help with that process, but i do not yet have the space or compute to finalize it. with compute, access to core tech, and interested parties, i can make motel sunshine the first VR-native episodic series. it would be very fun and very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Struck&lt;/strong&gt; - homestruck is the story of a child searching for their place and their people, but first needing to experience the world. written as a second-person novel, the reader becomes part of the story in a way that feels personal and direct. you follow Sam&#39;s path through difficult decisions in life, and in the end you decide for yourself whether those decisions were for the better. the VR filmic release puts the viewer into that same story world. in the written narrative, you are the anonymous &quot;you&quot; character; in the VR 6DoF experience, you move through a person&#39;s life in a way that can be revisited again and again, but never in exactly the same way twice. this &lt;mark&gt;Work in Progress&lt;/mark&gt; is still being written. the filmic release is limited by current recording technology (outdoors, on location, with a movable rig), editing, and distribution. writing for VR filmic 6DoF experiences is also limited by how applicable current script-writing methods are.&lt;/p&gt;
